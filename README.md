Speech Emotion Classification

Overview

This project is a Speech Emotion Classification system that uses deep learning to analyze audio recordings and predict emotions from speech. It is implemented using Python and includes a trained model for real-time emotion detection.

Features

Predicts emotions from speech recordings

Uses a pre-trained deep learning model (speech_emotion_model.h5)

Can process .wav audio files

Suitable for real-time applications

Dataset

The data/ folder contains .wav files used for training and testing the model. Ensure you have sufficient labeled data for best results.

Model

The project includes a trained deep learning model (speech_emotion_model.h5). If you wish to train your own model, check the scripts inside the code/ directory.
